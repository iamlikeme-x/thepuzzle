# The Puzzle
This is a code-challenge I was set following an interview.

### Files
Each piece consists of 4 sides, and is represented by a single character:
 - `B`: Bump
 - `S`: Straight
 - `I`: Indentation

At the top of the file, put the number of rows to read, then on each line below, put a puzzle piece definition, starting with the top side and working your way round clockwise.

(see `tests/puzzle1` for example)

### Usage
To run the puzzle solver, type the following command in the terminal:

`php ./index.php path/to/file`

### Result
The result will tell you how many possible combinations of the puzzle there are.
